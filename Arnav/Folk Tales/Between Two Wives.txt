A middle-aged man had two wives, one about the same age as him and the other much younger. Since the wives quarreled a lot, the man built two houses for each of them in different parts of town. They came to a mutual agreement that the man would stay with each of them on alternate days. Whenever he stayed with the younger wife, she plucked out his grey hair, as she wanted her husband to look younger. When he stayed with his first wife, she plucked out all his dark hair, as she didnâ€™t want him to look any younger than herself. As a result, the poor man ended up without a single hair on his head.
