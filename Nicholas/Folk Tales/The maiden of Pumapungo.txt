Pumapungo, located in Cuenca, was the destination of rest preferred by the Inca emperors. This place was impressively decorated and today it is possible to visit its ruins. The place counted on a sacred source that was used exclusively by the emperor.

He was also attended by maidens known as the Virgins of the Sun. These women were raised from small in different arts and skills that used to entertain the emperors.

Nina was one of the Virgins of the Sun residing in Pumapungo and although it was prohibited, she fell in love with one of the priests of the temple. This pair used to gather on full moon nights in the gardens of the place.

When the Emperor learned of this fact he ordered the priest to be killed, but he forbade Nina to be informed of this.

The maid, seeing that her lover did not attend her meetings, finally died of moral sorrow. It is said that today in the same nights of full moon can be heard its lament among the ruins of the place.
