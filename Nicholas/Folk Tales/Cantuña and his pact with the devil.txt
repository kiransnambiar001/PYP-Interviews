Cantu単a and his pact with the devil:

Cantu単a was a respected indigenous in the colonial times to which he was entrusted with the construction of the atrium of the Church of San Francisco in Quito.

The pay for this work was very good, but the condition was that it had to be done in the shortest possible time. Cantu単a then decided to sell his soul to the devil with the condition that all the stones of the atrium were placed there before the first rays of the sun came out.

He recorded on a stone that anyone who touched it would recognize God alone. Three little demons who worked that night could not touch the stone and left the construction incomplete.

When the devil came to take the soul of Cantu単a, he claimed that the work had not been completed and that therefore could not meet the deal, winning his soul back.
